This project demonstrates my understanding of web design for Code Lousiville's Front End Website Development Course 2021. The concept is a simple account login for a website using the HTML Form.

The following features were included in the project: 
    
    1. A hamburger menu the opens and hides navigation links on the website. When the hamburger menu is clicked it opens the links formatted in a column. The menu bar also appears on the screen horizontally at 30% width at 768 pixels and full width at 996 pixels.

    2. The hamburger menu has a slight animation when clicked.

    3. The email and password inputs are validated and must have the correct credentials. If nothing is entered or the incorrect credentials are entered, a message will pop up saying, "Please enter correct credentials".
        a. THE CREDENTIALS FOR THE FORM ARE: EMAIL: admin@example.com PASSWORD: password
        b. Once the correct credentials are submitted a message will display a message saying, "Welcome admin@example.com"
